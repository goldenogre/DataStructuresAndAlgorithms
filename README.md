# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
> This repository will contain small classes that contain algorithms for searching and/or sorting.
## Purpose
The focus of this project is to have a collection of algorithms that I can refer back to as a learning guide. The algorithms display basic 
concepts and are a combination of my own uderstanding, and examples seen online, or in textbooks. There are many ways to implement algorithms.
There may be classes that have different versions to look at. There may be optimized, recursive, and/or iterative versions to look at. 

_Implement.java_ is a class that is used to test the code by creating instances of a class using switch statements. This isn't really needed, but 
I wanted a way to test all the code as it is written, class by class.
